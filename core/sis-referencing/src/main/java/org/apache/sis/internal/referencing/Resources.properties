AmbiguousEllipsoid_1             = Ambiguity between inverse flattening and semi minor axis length for \u201c{0}\u201d. Using inverse flattening.
ConformanceMeansDatumShift       = This result indicates if a datum shift method has been applied.
ConstantProjParameterValue_1     = This parameter is shown for completeness, but should never have a value different than {0} for this projection.
DeprecatedCode_3                 = Code \u201c{0}\u201d is deprecated and replaced by code {1}. Reason is: {2}
FallbackDefaultFactoryVersion_2  = There is no factory for version {1} of \u201c{0}\u201d authority. Fallback on default version for objects creation.
GeodeticDataBase_4               = {0} geodetic dataset version {1} on \u201c{2}\u201d version {3}.
IgnoredServiceProvider_3         = More than one service provider of type \u2018{0}\u2019 are declared for \u201c{1}\u201d. Only the first provider (an instance of \u2018{2}\u2019) will be used.
InverseOperationUsesSameSign     = Inverse operation uses the same parameter value.
InverseOperationUsesOppositeSign = Inverse operation uses this parameter value with opposite sign.
LoadingDatumShiftFile_1          = Loading datum shift file \u201c{0}\u201d.
MismatchedOperationFactories_2   = No coordinate operation from \u201c{0}\u201d to \u201c{1}\u201d because of mismatched factories.
MismatchedEllipsoidAxisLength_3  = The \u201c{1}\u201d parameter could have been omitted. But it has been given a value of {2} which does not match the definition of the \u201c{0}\u201d ellipsoid.
MisnamedParameter_1              = Despite its name, this parameter is effectively \u201c{0}\u201d.
NotFormalProjectionParameter_1   = This parameter borrowed from the \u201c{0}\u201d projection is not formally a parameter of this projection.
