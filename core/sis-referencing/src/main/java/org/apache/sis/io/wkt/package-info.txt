There is no package-info.java file in this directory because that file is
defined in the sis-metadata module. Splitting a package in two modules is
not a recommended practice, but we make an exception for this WKT package
for dependencies reason. The split is:

* 'sis-metadata' module provides formatting capability and a base Parser.
* 'sis-referencing' module adds parsing capability on top of above parser.

Formatting does not need to know all classes in advance since we just
invoke an overrideable method. But parsing needs to know all classes,
which is why we have to define it in the referencing module (at least
for the current SIS version).
