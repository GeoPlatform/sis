ConstantValueRequired_3           = Apache SIS implementation requires that all \u201c{0}\u201d elements have the same value, but the element found in \u201c{1}\u201d are {2}.
ComputedValueForAttribute_2       = No value specified for the \u201c{0}\u201d TIFF tag. Computed the {1} value from other tags.
DefaultValueForAttribute_2        = No value specified for the \u201c{0}\u201d TIFF tag. The {1} default value will be used.
DitheringOrHalftoningMatrixSize_2 = The dithering or halftoning matrix size is {0}\u00d7{1}.
IgnoredTag_1                      = The \u201c{0}\u201d TIFF tag has been ignored.
InconsistentTileStrip_1           = TIFF image \u201c{0}\u201d shall be either tiled or organized into strips.
MismatchedLength_4                = TIFF tags \u201c{0}\u201d and \u201c{1}\u201d have values of different lengths. Found \u201c{2}\u201d and \u201c{3}\u201d elements respectively.
MissingValue_2                    = Can not read TIFF image from \u201c{0}\u201d because the \u201c{1}\u201d tag is missing.
Threshholding2                    = An ordered dither or halftone technique has been applied to the image data.
Threshholding3                    = A randomized process such as error diffusion has been applied to the image data.
UnexpectedKeyValue_3              = Unexpected value for the \u201c{0}\u201d GeoTIFF key. Expected value {1} but found {2}.
